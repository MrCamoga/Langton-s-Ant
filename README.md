# Langton's Ant 
Multicolor extension of Langton's Ant cellular automaton program that finds highways and its period

It supports square and hexagonal grids

## TODO
- [ ] Server
  - [x] Create server to submit ants tested by users
  - [x] Send rules to clients to test so that no rule is tested multiple times
  - [ ] Verify rules by different clients
  - [x] Store rules tested and verified by each user for credit
  - [ ] Prevent people from sending false data (trust system based on rule verification by other users)
- [ ] Webpage to visualize all the data
- [ ] Improve GUI
- [ ] Different work types:
  - [x] Check new rules
  - [ ] Verify rules 
  - [ ] Approximate period of big highways
  - [ ] Find exact period of big highways
- [x] Algorithm to differentiate between highways/triangles/squares
- [ ] Parallel computing

#### How we found the huge highways
The rules that start with the same letters often behave very similar. When we find rules with a long period, we test the ones that start in the same way to find even longer highways.


#### Some functions that generate lots of highways
