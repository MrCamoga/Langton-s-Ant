# Langton's Ant 
Multicolor extension of Langton's Ant cellular automaton program that finds highways and its period

## TODO
- [x] Create server to submit ants tested by users (in PHP or Java)

	-[x]Send rules to clients to test so that no rule is tested multiple times
	
	-Verify rules by different clients
	-[x]Store rules tested and verified by each user for credit
	-Prevent people from sending false data (trust system based on rule verification by other users)
- [ ] Webpage to visualize all the data
- [ ] Improve GUI
- [x] Save huge raster of highway to estimate its period. This could be use to determine if computing the period is feasible (i.e. if the estimated period is 1e17 it'd take 50 years!!)
- [x] Autosave ant state
- [ ] Different work types:

	- Check new rules
	
	- Verify rules (mostly periods)
	
	- Approximate period of big highways (or triangles/squares to discard them)
	
	- Find exact period of big highways
	
- [ ] Alg to differenciate between highways/triangles/squares

## How does it work?
The program will run through all the rules and try to automatically detect highways

After the ant reaches maximum iterations or highway has been found, the program will skip to another rule and will output to the command line all the rules that form highways along with its period.

**Example output:**

```

it/s = iterations per second

All rules tested are sent to the server and stored in the database.
	
## Settings
#### Find highways:
*	**detectHighways**: program will try to detect highways if this is true
*	**ignoreSavedRules**: ignores rules that have already been tested
*	**chunkCheck**: when the ant exits that chunk, the program will start finding the highway
*	**repeatcheck**: # of times the period has to repeat before the highway period is confirmed
*	**maxiterations**: skip to next rule if limit reached

#### Save images:
*	**savepic**: if true rules with highways will be saved to disk in the folder /"period"/"rule".png (e.g. the regular Langton's Ant would be saved to /104/2.png)

#### When finding period of huge highways:
*	**deleteOldChunks**: deletes chunks that haven't been visited by the ant in the last 100M steps  to free up memory

#### How I found these huge highways
Whenever I found a big highway such as <span style="color:red">**RRLRLLRLLLRRRR**</span>RR (31819) or <span style="color:blue">**RRLRLLRRLRRRRRR**</span> (32459), I tested all rules that started in the same way because they usually have similar behaviour.

Since I read the rules backwards (e.g. RRRLRR -> 110111 = 55) I can test rules that start with the same **n** letters really easily:

```java
	Simulation.init(31819, r -> r+(1<<n));
```
This code will test the following rules (with **n=14** will test every **16384th** rule)

|Rule|Binary| String |
|:-:|-:|:-|
|31819 |  1**11110001001011**  | **RRLRLLRLLLRRRR**R |
|48203 | 10**11110001001011**  | **RRLRLLRLLLRRRR**LR|
|64587 | 11**11110001001011**  | **RRLRLLRLLLRRRR**RR|
|80971 | 100**11110001001011** | **RRLRLLRLLLRRRR**LLR|
|...|...|
